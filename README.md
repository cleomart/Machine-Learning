# Machine-Learning
Implement a binary perceptron for a set of data, and build and train a neural network that approximates sin(x) over 
[−2π , 2π], classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, and identifies language in a dataset that consists of words in five languages.

This project is completed for CS188: Artificial Intelligenece at University of California, Berkeley during Fall 2018.
